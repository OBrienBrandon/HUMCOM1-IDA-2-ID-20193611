              the Burnham Park Master Development Plan donated by the University of the Cordilleras (UC) to the City of Baguio. According to the website of UC, 
              the plan they have given to the city incorporates “Green Architectures and Sustainable and Organic approach” in its planning and design.
              <br>
              <br>
              Rose Garden can now live up to its name as it is now surrounded with roses. The roses in different 
              colors were dominant in the garden as it can be seen all around. Seats are also provided for those 
              who visit the garden.
              <br>
              <br>
              There are also spaces provided wherein groups of teenagers may practice dance steps and play 
              some sports like badminton. During the nights, the garden is lightened up with LED lights. 
              The garden is also equipped with speakers to add more feeling to the ambiance, so visitors can 
              sing along with the music.</h2></fieldset>

                    Baguio was a former mining town in the early 20th century. To get a glimpse of that past, 
                    you have to visit Mines View Park. This park sits on a ridge on the northeast side of Baguio. 
                    Exploring the park is one of the recommended leisure activities in Baguio.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As such, its main attraction is a viewing deck that offers a stunning view of 
                    the Cordillera Mountains and Benguet's old copper and gold mines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tourists are given a chance to dress in traditional Ifugao garbs like bahag (loincloth), vests, 
                    and headdresses, and even hold a shield and spear for picture-taking. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can also get your 
                    fix of Baguio's signature strawberry taho at Mines View Park. You won't have trouble finding 
                    taho vendors here as they are everywhere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mines View Park is also a great spot to buy souvenirs. There are several shops here 
                    that sell woven items, knitted garments, wooden souvenirs, as well as silverworks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You will also find rows of succulents, flowers, and bonsai trees you can purchase.</h2></fieldset>

                    is one of the most beautiful places in Baguio and provides a much-needed tranquil space amid bustling 
                    Baguio City. In 2009, the garden was renamed Centennial Park in celebration of Baguio's 100th year as the 
                    Summer Capital of the Philippines.

                    However, it is more known as the Botanical Garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Exploring the garden is a whole adventure on its own, as it has several sections with different attractions. 
                    As you enter the park, you will be greeted by a giant sculpture. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This bronze masterpiece is the work of Ben Hur Villanueva, a renowned Filipino sculptor. 
                    The statue represents the of the Cordillerans, Americans, Chinese, and Japanese in building Baguio.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Filled with pine trees, the Botanical Garden has two purposes. It serves a hideaway from the often crowded 
                    Baguio. It also houses nurseries dedicated to propagating flora that will eventually be replanted in 
                    the parks and gardens of Baguio. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the abundance of trees and different plants, the Baguio Botanical Garden is truly a great place to unwind.
                     You can explore the various sections, sit by the benches, or have a snack under the cottages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You will find pocket gardens and pavilions dedicated to Baguio's sister cities in countries such as South Korea,
                    Japan, China, Canada, Thailand, and the USA.

              values and way of life of its people. It is based on the legend of Sab-angan which is believed to be an

              The man-made park is built on a mountainside where owner Pio Velasco said was the exact location 
              where he had a sighting of a white carabao. Velasco took the white carabao as a sign to build the 
              structure. According to him, the park is a representation of both the new and old Igorot culture. 
              It also serves as a tribute to his Igorot mother Rita “Rosing” Gal Velasco whom he described as a 
              strong and patient woman.</h1></fieldset>
